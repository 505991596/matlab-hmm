2015.9.14 Begin write this HMM code. I try to use Murphy's and other's code but not very suitable for me. So decide to write myself. 
2015.9.29 It is not finished yet. the diecrete HMM and mono-gauss continuous GMM works well in isolated word recognition (Lab 220 dataset), 20 words. 50% accuracy using mono-gauss HMM. I do not know why mixture GMM-HMM not working well. Maybe initial values, maybe bugs. 
2015.11.17 GMM-HMM fished.
